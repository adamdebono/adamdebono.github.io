<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>I've developed a couple of projects over the years. Unfortunately I don't get much time to work on them anymore, but here they are anyway.</p>

<div class="projects">
	<a class="project" ng-repeat="project in projects" ng-href="#/projects/{{project.path}}">
		<img ng-src="assets/images/projects/icons/{{project.path}}.png"/>
		{{project.title}}
	</a>
</div>
