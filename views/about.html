<p>I'm an iOS and web developer from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/?q=Wollongong,+Australia">Wollongong, Australia</a>. I have a passion for creating great experiences through software. I love finding new ways to use intuitive interaction to develop a fantastic user experience.</p>
<p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au" target="_blank">University of Wollongong</a> and am employed at <a href="http://www.affinitylive.com" target="_blank">AffinityLive</a>. I've also worked on a few of my own <a href="#/projects">projects</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you've got an interesting project - my main skills are programming for iOS and the web, but I'd be happy to change it up and learn something new. My preferred method of contact is <a href="mailto:me@adamdebono.com">email</a>, which is regularly checked and usually replied to fairly quickly. I'd be happy to organise a call or face to face if you'd rather that.</p>
